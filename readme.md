I originally created a MCTS algorithm in C++, but I kept running into bugs, so to simplify the coding process a bit, and to actually understand the algorithm, I switched to Python....just briefly. A C++ version will also be up.

I'm going to try to optimize this, create a parallel version, and modify the Board Class to be a BitBoard for memory efficiency.
